     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <p><ol>
         <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            Cream together butter and sugar, then beat in egg, pumpkin puree and 1/4 cup milk until smooth. Stir in flour until a dough forms, then knead a few times on a well floured surface until the dough holds together. Press the dough into a flat circle 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Cut into 6 wedges, place onto greased baking sheet, and brush the tops with 2 tablespoons of milk.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and bottom, 10 to 15 minutes. Once done, wrap scones with a clean dish towel and allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
